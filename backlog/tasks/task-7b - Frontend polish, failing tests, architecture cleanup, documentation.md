## Session History

<!-- Update as work progresses -->

- 2025-08-05 12:07 UTC – Began implementation; architect spec completed; branch feat/task-7b-frontend-polish in use.
- 2025-08-05 12:13 UTC – Frontend redesign complete. Implemented new components (NoteCard, EditNoteModal, SearchBar, ThemeToggle), theme context for light/dark mode, and updated App.jsx to use them. All unit tests are passing.
- 2025-08-05 12:48 UTC – Polished frontend: fixed search bug, added delete functionality, and implemented a dynamic version header. Updated all related tests.
- 2025-08-05 13:26 UTC – Search bug fixed, delete button fixed, manual deployment performed (image pulls successfully). Remaining issues: missing “Notes – v2” banner version not displayed; note content still not rendered in UI.

## Decisions Made

- Implemented a responsive grid layout for the notes list.
- Used CSS variables for easy theming and maintenance.
- Persisted the theme preference in localStorage.
- Added a modal for editing notes to provide a better user experience.
- Separated `allNotes` from `filteredNotes` state to prevent data loss on search.
- Version number is now read from `VITE_APP_VERSION` environment variable to allow for dynamic versioning in CI/CD.
- Helm deployment.yaml template was restored to a correct image path.
