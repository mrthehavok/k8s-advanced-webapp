status: "Done"
created: 2025-08-01
updated: 2025-08-03

## Description

Develop a lightweight React single-page application for “Team Notes”:

- Pages:
  - Notes list with search & create button
  - Note editor (Markdown textarea with preview)
  - Note view/read mode
- API integration with backend CRUD endpoints
- State management: React Query or simple context/hooks
- Routing via React Router v6
- Styling: TailwindCSS or minimal CSS-in-JS
- Environments: base URL from env vars
- Liveness route: `/` returns static index

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Source in `services/frontend/` (TypeScript, Vite or CRA)
- [x] `Dockerfile` multi-stage, final image <150 MB
- [x] Unit/component tests (Jest + React Testing Library) ≥80 %
- [x] GitHub Action runs lint & tests
- [x] App works against local backend (makefile/dev script)
- [x] README with dev and build instructions
