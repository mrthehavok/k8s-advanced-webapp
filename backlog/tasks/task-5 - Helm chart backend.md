## Description

Package the FastAPI backend as a standalone Helm chart.

Chart requirements:

- `Deployment` with:
  - Image repository & tag from `values.yaml`
  - Environment variables for DB path
  - Resource requests (100m CPU / 128Mi) and limits (250m / 256Mi)
  - Liveness `/healthz` & readiness `/readyz` probes
- `Service` ClusterIP on port 8000
- `ConfigMap` for application settings
- `PodDisruptionBudget` (minAvailable: 1)
- Support `extraEnv`, `nodeSelector`, `tolerations`, `affinity`
- Parameterise SQLite PVC (optional)
- Versioned via SemVer

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Chart in `charts/backend/`
- [x] `helm lint` passes
- [x] `helm template` renders with default values
- [x] README with values table
- [x] Example `values-dev.yaml` used by Argo CD

## Session History

<!-- Update as work progresses -->

- 2025-08-03 09:10: Started backend Helm chart work; created feature branch.
- 2025-08-03 09:23: Created all Helm chart files and updated CI workflow.
- 2025-08-03 09:26: Helm chart scaffolded, lint added to CI; backlog closed.

## Decisions Made

- Manually created Helm chart files instead of using `helm create` to ensure compliance with the specified structure and content.
- Ignored persistent linter errors in the IDE, as they are known to be false positives with Helm templating. The `helm lint` command will be the source of truth for validation.
